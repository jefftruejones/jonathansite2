          <p className={styles.p}>
            I am very passionate and energized by the opportunity I have to help
            others. I do this through bodywork and promoting self-care habits to
            decrease, and ideally, eliminate physical discomfort. I am led by my
            intuition, and each session is orchestrated around what feels
            problematic for each individual person. I believe that our inner
            world is deeply connected to the more external physical experiences
            and I honor this intertwined system by intentionally creating a
            space that feels safe for all people.
