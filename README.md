This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Context

> * This is one of my first professional projects for a local client here in Durham, NC. This client formerly had only a facebook page to manage their business and clientele, and wanted a website/app that could serve as one hub for client management and interaction.

# User: 

> * This site is intended for both the massage therapist, current clients, and potential clients of the massage therapist to be able to stay in touch, book appoints, etc.

# Use: 

> * This is primarily a brochure site for a local business

# Features: 

> * Currently, the site features a minimalist design that is fully responsive, built with NEXT.js and custom CSS. Right now appoints are requsted through a contact form.

# Technologies used: 

> * Next.Js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Strapi.io (headless CMS), and Vercel

# Discoveries: 

> * This is my first real project with an actual client. I've learned a lot about the development process when you are working with someone who does not have a technical background. This is also my first foray into JAMstack development and Next.js

# Future goals for this project: 

> * In the next few months, I am going to automate client scheduling, likely with something like acuity, google calendar, or calendly. In addition, I am going to implement and host the headless CMS backend for the blog functionality.
